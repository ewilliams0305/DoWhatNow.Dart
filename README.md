A Result package for Dart (and Flutter of course) designed around fluent APIs and a functional approach to error handling, because things go wrong!
This package will help you process the `DO` without verbosity while forgetting all about the `WHAT`.  
The `DO` being the happy path an application may take, and the `WHAT` being short for `WTF`.  Complete your process and find out what went wrong and what went wrong.
